# C# Projects
Just some projects that will be posted while I am working and learning about C#. 

## Contents
- Queries: Testing out how LINQ Queries work, and how they are very powerful
- Data Structures: Testing out how C# Data Structures work

## About

I am most familiar with Swift and Python, although I prefer Swift because of its type-safe nature. It would be interesting to see how C# measures to Swift, and from some basic research, I found that C# surpases Swift in functionality.

For example, if an application is fetching data from a website that returns multi-types of 2D Arrays, JSON Deserialization and using the `Codable` protocol would not be easy, as you would `try` to cast every object into an string, integer, or double. To include multiple types in an array, you would set the type to be `Array<Any>`, which then you loose the point of a type-safe language. This would be very helpful in C# because of the `dynamic` type, in which you could set the type of something to be known at run-time instead of compile time - the app has to be running to know the type of something (just like interpreted Python!).

## Planning to Include
- LINQ: Implementations of LINQ in C# including queries, applications and just plain working with it.
  - Partially done. Will work on more advanced and bigger data structures to query
- Object Oriented Programming like classes and enums
- JSON Serialization/Deserialization
